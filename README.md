# Event Countdown Landing Page

## Project Overview
This project is a simple event landing page that promotes an upcoming event
and displays a live countdown timer. It focuses on clean UI, basic UX decisions,
and beginner-friendly JavaScript logic.

## Features
- Event hero section
- Live countdown timer (Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds)
- Event description
- Activities section
- Call-to-action with form validation

## How the Countdown Works
The countdown uses JavaScript's Date object to calculate the time difference
between the current date and the event date. The remaining time is updated
every second using setInterval().

## Challenges Faced
- Understanding date and time calculations
- Structuring layout properly
- Making the page responsive

## What I Learned
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Time-based JavaScript logic
- Page layout using Flexbox and Grid
- Basic form validation
